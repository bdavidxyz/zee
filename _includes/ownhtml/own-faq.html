        <p class="lead"><strong>What are alternatives ?</strong></p>
        <p class="card-text">You can use a free template, but chances are that you will struggle with addition of missing sections, then landing page optimization. You can also use recently open-sourced elementor.com, but it is not particularly focused on conversion, you also have a technology lock (Wordpress), and you will have to pay hosting one day. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card-block text-xs-center">
        <p class="lead"><strong>Why is it free ?</strong></p>
        <p class="card-text">There are tons of commercial tools to build landing page. As a developer, I'm used to work with open-source, and I needed a free tool. This is why I built it and released it to the community. </p>

      <div class="card card-block text-xs-center">
        <p class="lead"><strong>Is it a Bootstrap template ?</strong></p>
        <p class="card-text">Yes and no. It's a starter kit to create a Bootstrap template. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card-block text-xs-center">
        <p class="lead"><strong>Do I need technical skills ?</strong></p>
        <p class="card-text">Yes, but not much. Minimal requirement is to know very little basis of HTML, CSS and JS. Or at least, you're not afraid of them. You also have to use command-line.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card-block text-xs-center">
        <p class="lead"><strong>What if the section I want is missing ?</strong></p>
        <p class="card-text">Create an issue on GitHub, so that it can be added as a feature on the next version. Another option is to code it yourself and create a puul request so that everybody can benefit of it.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card-block text-xs-center">
        <p class="lead"><strong>What are opinions behind the tool ?</strong></p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Font pairing and color scheme are first citizen to convey the right message /
          Copywriting is as equally important /
          You don't need complex design to convert /
          You need to maximise text font size /
          Blazing fast rendering is not an option /
          You have to minimize user-required actions
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card-block text-xs-center">
        <p class="lead"><strong>What's the technical stack ?</strong></p>
        <p class="card-text">For most advanced users only : The project is a JekyllRB project. Each section has a portion of HTML template, with optionnally a SASS and JS file, built on top of Bootstrap 4 and jQuery 2. The build tool is GulpJS, using a combination of the Jekyll buil and npm build tools.</p>
